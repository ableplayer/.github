## Welcome to Able Player!

**What is Able Player?**

Able Player is a free, open-source, fully accessible HTML5 media player. It's designed to be usable by everyone, including those with disabilities, by providing features like keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and support for captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions.

This project is developed with an accessibility-first perspective. There is no attempt to retain backwards compatibility if that compatibility depends on avoiding fixing an accessibility issue. 

**Who created Able Player?**

Able Player was created by Terrill Thompson. Terrill created the player between 2010 and 2014, and maintained it until May 2025, when he passed the torch to [Joe Dolson](https://www.joedolson.com), the current lead developer. 

**How can I help?**

The Able Player organization contains two repositories at this time - the Able Player package itself, and an Able Player WordPress plugin. Opening issues, reporting bugs, and contributing code is welcome! Please review the [contributing guidelines for the repository](https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/contributing.html) and the [community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

**How is Able Player funded?**

Able Player does not, at this time, have any source of funding. If you'd like to help fund continued development, you can join [Joe Dolson's Github Sponsors account](https://github.com/sponsors/joedolson). If you want to sponsor significant contributions, don't hesitate to reach out!
